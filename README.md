# QuickWorkout
Android App to provide a Quick Workout choice for easy decision about what to do and timing.

This app was a response to COVID-19 in the hopes of helping with trying to stay healthy at home by doing some small workouts between bursts of University work.

The app provides a list of stretches or core exercises which can be randomized to provide you with a random workout to do with a short timer. Allowing for easy pickup between
breaks to try and get a little bit of exercise in.
